### Analysis of People with Diabetes

Purpose: The purpose of this report is to make Visualize Data to better understand the different features before working on this as a Supervised Classification problem.



About the Dataset: The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv). The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.
