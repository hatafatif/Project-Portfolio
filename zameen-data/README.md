# Zameen-Data
#### About the Project:
The dataset was used to create a heatmap of different cities of Islamabad, with respect to the average price per marla of the respective area. The dataset can be filtered through houses, flats, penthouses, farmhouses etc. for both, Sale and Rent. The dataset was first imported into a Jupyter Notebook, and cleaned. Then, this data was transferred into Excel, where some more columns were added.  
#### Software used: 
Python, Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel
#### Dataset: 
[zameen-data](https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/zameen-property-pakistan/data) from Kaggle.
#### Description:
This dataset was webscraped from the popular property dealing website of Pakistan, [Zameen](www.zameen.com). It was webscraped a little while ago, and has data from 2018 to 2019. Also, the cities are limited to Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi and Faisalabad. 
#### Future Work: 
1. Webscrape the data again, so that the data is more relevant. 
2. More cities' data can be webscraped, and all the major cities of Pakistan can be mapped.
