# Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis

#### Software used: 
MySQL, PowerBI
#### Dataset: 
[Pharmaceutical Sales Volume dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/milanzdravkovic/pharma-sales-data) from Kaggle by the user [Milan ZdravkoviÄ‡.](https://www.kaggle.com/milanzdravkovic)
#### Description:
The dataset contained information about the Sales Volume of categories of drugs from January 2014 to October 2019. This dataset was used to create a schema (pharma_db), and different queries were written in order to obtain useful insights from the data. Then, using views, a Dashboard was created in PowerBI, which keeps track of the daily sales volume and trends. 
#### Future Work: 
1. A report could be made, analyzing different aspects of the Sales Volume data.
2. Another Dashboard could be made, which would analyize each cateogory individually.
3. Using these gained insights, this data could be fed into a ML algorithm to predict future sales. <sub><sup> I plan on doing this myself in the near future </sup></sub>

#### Snapshot of the Dashboard:
