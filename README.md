# Project Portfolio

On my journey to becoming a Data Scientist, this is a collection of all the projects I create. Most of these are going to be personal projects for practicing/learning a new skill. 

Feel free to download and use these projects for your own learning.

### Highlight Projects:
1. [Pharmaceutical Sales Volume Analysis (MySQL, PowerBI](https://github.com/hatafatif/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/PharmaceuticalSalesAnalysis): A dataset contained information about the Sales Volume of categories of drugs from January 2014 to October 2019. This dataset was used to create a schema (pharma_db), and different queries were written in order to obtain useful insights from the data. Then, using views, a Dashboard was created in PowerBI, which can keep track of the daily sales volume and trends.
2. [Diabetes Analysis (PowerBI)](https://github.com/hatafatif/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/DiabetesAnalysis_PowerBI): A dataset contained information about participants related to the symptoms of Diabetes. This dataset was used to create a PowerBI report, analyzing the different trends to understand the data better.
